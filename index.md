## About Me
I am a tech professional currently seeking software development, machine learning and data science related roles. Most recently, I applied my C++, Python and machine learning knowledge to client-specific projects as part of the production team at [wrnch AI](https://wrnch.ai/). I obtained my master's degree in electrical engineering at McGill University. My master's thesis research was focused on machine learning algorithm development, signal processing and statistical analysis for breast cancer screening using radio waves. I completed my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I graduated with distinction. During my undergrad, a co-op program, I had the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience at ON Semiconductor as a signal processing firmware development intern. I also worked at the University of Waterloo as a teaching assistant and as a research assistant. For additional information please see [my resume](/files/CollinAJosephResume.pdf).
