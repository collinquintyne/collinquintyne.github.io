## About Me
I am a graduate of the electrical engineering master's program at McGill University. Most recently, I applied my C++, Python and machine learning knowledge to client-specific projects as part of the production team at [wrnch AI](https://wrnch.ai/). My master's thesis research was focused on machine learning algorithm development, signal processing and statistical analysis for breast cancer screening using radio waves. I completed my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I graduated with distinction. During my undergrad, a co-op program, I had the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience at ON Semiconductor as a signal processing firmware development intern. I also worked at the University of Waterloo as a teaching assistant and as a research assistant. For additional information please see [my resume](/files/CollinAJosephResume.pdf).
