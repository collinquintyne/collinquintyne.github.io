### About Me
I am a recent graduate of the electrical engineering master's program at McGill University. My master's thesis research was focused on statistical analysis and machine learning algorithm development for breast cancer screening using radio waves. I completed my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I graduated with distinction. During my undergrad, a co-op program, I had the opportunity to gain valuable industry experience at ON Semiconductor as a signal processing firmware development intern. I also worked at the University of Waterloo as a teaching assistant and as a research assistant.
